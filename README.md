# Engineering Systems Analysis Rocky Project

## Abstract
Over the past half of a semester we have spent time learning about how real world phenomena can be implemented using a series of different response systems. Using the theoretical experience that we had acquired from applications such as modeling dampening gear and electromagnetic circuits, we were able to begin implementing a real-world application for this project. The goal of this project was to determine how to best balance an inverted pendulum controlled by a motor to stay balanced based on a feedback loop control system. In this paper we will be relaying the inner workings of our project’s results accompanied with our group’s reasoning and analysis.

## Deliverables
All documentation can be found in the reports folder.
- MATLAB live scripts (uploaded as PDFs) and Simulink model in `/matlab`.
- Arduino balancing code, source C++, and header file in `/arduino`.
